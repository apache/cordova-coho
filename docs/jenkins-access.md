## Access to Apache's jenkins CI setup

To get Jenkins access, the chair of Apache Cordova PMC must give a committer access by running a script, and adding their Apache ID. 
The PMC chair only has access to the server through ssh PKI (no password access), and must register their public key through [id.apache.org](http://id.apache.org).

For more details, see the [Jenkins Wiki](https://wiki.apache.org/general/Jenkins#How_do_I_get_an_account).

Go [here](https://whimsy.apache.org/roster/committee/cordova) to get a list of Apache IDs for the Apache Cordova TLP.
