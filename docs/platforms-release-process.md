# Release Process for ''Platforms Releases''

Before cutting any releases, read the Apache's [Releases Policy](http://www.apache.org/dev/release)

This page describes the technical steps for releasing a `Platforms Release` (see: [versioning-and-release-strategy.md](versioning-and-release-strategy.md)).

TODO: We may want to be using [signed tags](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Basics-Tagging), or at least annotated tags.

Replace `Android` with the platform you are releasing. 

## Get Buy-in

Email the dev mailing-list and see if anyone has reason to postpone the release.

E.g.:

    Subject: [DISCUSS] Cordova-Android Release

    Does anyone have any reason to delay a cordova-android platform release?
    Any outstanding patches to land?

    If not, I will start the release tomorrow.

## Creating JIRA issues

 * Create a JIRA issue to track the status of the release.
   * Make it of type "Task"
   * Title should be "Cordova-Android Platform Release _August 21, 2014_"
   * Description should be: "Following steps at https://github.com/apache/cordova-coho/blob/master/docs/platforms-release-process.md"
 * Comments should be added to this bug after each top-level step below is taken
 * Set a variable in your terminal for use later on:


    JIRA="CB-????" # Set this to the release bug.

## Update and Pin Dependencies
Ensure you're up-to-date:

    coho repo-update -r android

See if any dependencies are outdated

    (cd cordova-android && npm outdated --depth=0)

Update them in each project's `package.json` file. Make sure to run through the test section below for compatability issues. The `--depth=0` prevents from listing dependencies of dependencies.

Checkin updated modules (use npm 3.10.1+)

    rm -rf node_modules
    npm install --production (skips devDependencies)
    git add node_modules/* (checkin all modules needed for platform add git url)
    git commit -m "$JIRA Updated checked-in node_modules"
    npm install (Re-add devDependencies for ability to run tests locally)

## Release Check

Ensure license headers are present everywhere. For reference, see this [background](http://www.apache.org/legal/src-headers.html). Expect some noise in the output, for example some files from test fixtures will show up.
    
    coho audit-license-headers -r android | less
    
Ensure all dependencies and subdependencies have Apache-compatible licenses

    coho check-license -r android

## Prepare Release
Increase the version within package.json using SemVer, and remove the `-dev` suffix

    for l in cordova-android; do ( cd $l; v="$(grep '"version"' package.json | cut -d'"' -f4)"; if [[ $v = *-dev ]]; then v2="${v%-dev}"; echo "$l: Setting version to $v2"; sed -i '' -E 's/version":.*/version": "'$v2'",/' package.json; fi) ; done
    
If the changes merit it, manually bump the major / minor/ patch version in `package.json`. View the changes via:

    ( cd cordova-android && git log --pretty=format:'* %s' --topo-order --no-merges $(git describe --tags $(git rev-list --tags --max-count=1))..master )

Update the repos `RELEASENOTES.md` file with changes since the last release

    coho update-release-notes -r android
    # Then curate:
    vim cordova-android/RELEASENOTES.md

Commit these changes together into one commit

    (cd cordova-android && v="$(grep '"version"' package.json | cut -d'"' -f4)" && git commit -am "$JIRA Updated RELEASENOTES and Version for release $v")

---

**PATCH RELEASE NOTES**


If you have prepared the release notes in your release branch for a patch release, you will have to cherry-pick the RELEASENOTES only into your master branch as well (stage only the appropriate hunk).

    git checkout master
    git checkout -p RELEASENOTES_COMMIT_SHA_HASH
    
For iOS, you may have to cherry-pick the commit for `Added X.Y.Z to CDVAvailability.h (via coho)` into the master branch as well.

---

Prepare your release branch by using `coho prepare-release-branch` command, which handles the following steps:
 * Updating `cordova.js` snapshot
 * Creating a release branch (if it doesn't already exist)
 * Updating version numbers (`VERSION` file & package.json). On `master`, it gives version a minor bump and adds `-dev`
    
Run the following command (make sure to replace the version below  with what is listed inside `package.json`)

    coho prepare-release-branch --version 5.0.0 -r android
    # Ensure commits look okay on both branches
    coho repo-status -r android -b master -b 5.0.x

## Testing

Once all the repos are branched, we focus on testing & fixing all of the regressions we find.

When a regression is found:

 * Create a JIRA issue for it, and mark it as a blocker.

To submit a fix:

    git checkout master
    git commit -am 'Your commit message'
    git push origin master
    git log     # note the first five or six digits of the commit hash
    git checkout 5.0.x
    git cherry-pick -x commit_hash
    git push origin 5.0.x

### What to Test

1) Run [mobile-spec](http://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/cordova-mobile-spec.git). Don't forget to run through the manual tests in addition to the automatic tests.

    ```
    ./cordova-mobile-spec/createmobilespec/createmobilespec.js --android 
    (cd mobilespec && cordova run android --device)
    ```

2) Create a hello world app using the cordova CLI

    ```
    cordova create ./androidTest org.apache.cordova.test androidTest
    (cd androidTest && cordova platform add ../cordova-android)
    (cd androidTest && cordova run android --device)
    ```

3) Run your platform's `./bin/create` script. Ensure generated project builds & runs both through an IDE and through the cordova/* scripts

    
    ```
    ./cordova-android/bin/create ./androidTest2 org.apache.cordova.test2 androidTest2
    (cd androidTest2 && ./cordova/build)
    (cd androidTest2 && ./cordova/run --device)
    ```

4) Test Project Upgrade via CLI:

    ```
    cordova create ./androidTest3 org.apache.cordova.test3 androidTest3
    (cd androidTest3 && cordova platform add android@4.1.1)
    (cd androidTest3 && cordova platform update ../cordova-android)
    (cd androidTest3 && cordova run android --device)
    (cd androidTest3 && cordova platform ls)
    ```

The output from `cordova platform ls` should show the new version of `cordova-android`.

5) Test Project Upgrade for non-cli projects:

    ```
    (cd cordova-android && git checkout 4.1.x)
    ./cordova-android/bin/create ./androidTest4 org.apache.cordova.test4 androidTest4
    (cd cordova-android && git checkout 5.0.x)
    (cd androidTest4 && ../cordova-android/bin/update .)
    (cd androidTest4 && ./cordova/build)
    (cd androidTest4 && ./cordova/run --device)
    (cd androidTest4 && ./cordova/version)
    ```

The output from `./cordova/version` should show the new version of `cordova-android`.

 6) Run cordova-lib tests

    ```
    (cd cordova-lib/cordova-lib && npm test)
    ```

Feel free to cleanup the projects you just created

    ```
    rm -rf androidTest*
    ```

#### Android Extras

 * Unit tests in: [test](https://github.com/apache/incubator-cordova-android/tree/master/test) directory

#### iOS Extras

 * Unit tests in: [CordovaLibTests/CordovaTests.xcodeproj](https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf?p=cordova-ios.git;a=tree;f=CordovaLibTests;h=88ba8e3c286159151b378efb1b0c39ef26dac550;hb=HEAD)
 * Test the Makefile via `make`

## Push Changes:

    coho repo-status -r android -b master -b 5.0.x
    # If changes look right:
    coho repo-push -r android -b master -b 5.0.x

Tag & Push:

    coho tag-release --version 3.5.0 -r android --pretend
    # Seems okay:
    coho tag-release --version 3.5.0 -r android
    
The `coho tag-release` command also tags `cordova-js` with `android-5.0.0` and pushes it.

## Publish RC to dist/dev
Ensure you have the svn repos checked out:

    coho repo-clone -r dist -r dist/dev

Create archives from your tags:

    coho create-archive -r android --dest cordova-dist-dev/$JIRA --tag 3.5.0

Sanity Check:

    coho verify-archive cordova-dist-dev/$JIRA/*.tgz

Upload:

    (cd cordova-dist-dev && svn add $JIRA && svn commit -m "$JIRA Uploading release candidates for android release")

Find your release here: https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/cordova/

## Documentation To Update

For your platform:
 1. Ensure the [Upgrade Guide](http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/platforms/android/upgrade.html) for your platform is up-to-date
 2. Ensure the other guides listed in the sidebar are up-to-date for your platform

## Prepare Blog Post
 * Gather highlights from RELEASENOTES.md into a Release Announcement blog post
 * Instructions on publishing a blog post are on the [cordova-docs repo](https://github.com/apache/cordova-docs#writing-a-blog-post)
 * Get blog post proofread by submitting a PR to cordova-docs and asking someone on dev list to +1 it.

## Uploading to Bintray (Android only)

1. Add your bintray username and password as system variables. Your BINTRAY_USER and BINTRAY_KEY should be cordova username and key respectively. Ask the Project Management Committee (pmc) for the cordova credentials. Confirm that your key and user name are set:

```
    echo $BINTRAY_USER 
    echo $BINTRAY_KEY
``` 

2. Run the following command (replace 6.2.2 with released version):

```
    (cd cordova-android/framework && git checkout 6.2.2 && gradle bintrayUpload)
```

## Add permanent apache release tag

Make a copy of your released tag with a prefix of `rel\YOURTAG`. These are permanent release tags for Apache. 

    (cd cordova-android; git checkout 5.1.0; git tag rel/5.1.0; git push origin --tags; git checkout master)

##  Details

### Tell Apache about Release

1. Go to: https://reporter.apache.org/addrelease.html?cordova
2. Use version "cordova-$PLATFORM@x.x.x"

### Update the Docs

Follow the README at https://github.com/apache/cordova-docs

### Announce It!
 1. Announce the release to the world!
   * Create a blog post for it (instructions on [sites page README](https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/cordova/site/README.md))
   * Tweet it on https://twitter.com/apachecordova
   * Announce to [G+ Page](https://plus.google.com/u/0/113178331525415522084/posts)
   * Get it posted to Apache's announce mailing list: send an mail to announce@apache.org, sent from your @apache.org email address. Send in plain text, and copy the model of other announcements in the archive(s). You'll then need to wait for the moderator to accept the message. The www.a.o home page is automatically updated with the announcement after the moderator approves.
   * For major project milestones, email press@apache.org and they can provide custom help.

## Moving Tags

If you need to move a tag before the release, here is how to do that:

    $ git tag -d 3.1.0
    Deleted tag '3.1.0' (was 2a9bc20)
    $ git push origin :refs/tags/3.1.0
    To https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/cordova-docs.git
     - [deleted]         3.1.0
    $ git tag 3.1.0 7cf9fea03d7d02a13aef97a09a459e8128bd3198
    $ git push origin 3.1.0 && git push origin refs/tags/3.1.0
    Total 0 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
    To https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/cordova-docs.git
     * [new tag]         3.1.0 -> 3.1.0
    git commit --allow-empty -m "empty commit to update tag on github mirror"
    git push origin

Then send a note to the mailing list:

    To verify you have the updated tag in your local clone, doing a "git rev-parse 3.1.0" in cordova-docs should reply with "7cf9fea03d7d02a13aef97a09a459e8128bd3198". If it is wrong, do "git fetch --tags".
