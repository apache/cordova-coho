# Release Process for ''Platforms Releases''

Before cutting any releases, read the Apache's [Releases Policy](http://www.apache.org/dev/release)

This page describes the technical steps for releasing a `Platforms Release` (see: [versioning-and-release-strategy.md](versioning-and-release-strategy.md)).

TODO: We may want to be using [signed tags](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Basics-Tagging), or at least annotated tags.

Replace `Android` with the platform you are releasing. 

## Get Buy-in

Email the dev mailing-list and see if anyone has reason to postpone the release.

E.g.:

    Subject: [DISCUSS] Cordova-Android Release

    Does anyone have any reason to delay a cordova-android platform release?
    Any outstanding patches to land?

    If not, I will start the release tomorrow.

## Creating JIRA issues

 * Create a JIRA issue to track the status of the release.
   * Make it of type "Task"
   * Title should be "Cordova-Android Platform Release _August 21, 2014_"
   * Description should be: "Following steps at https://github.com/apache/cordova-coho/blob/master/docs/platforms-release-process.md"
 * Comments should be added to this bug after each top-level step below is taken
 * Set a variable in your terminal for use later on:


    JIRA="CB-????" # Set this to the release bug.

## Branch & Tag for Platform Repository

### Before creating the release branch:

 1. Run [Apache RAT](http://creadur.apache.org/rat/) to ensure copyright headers are present
   * `coho audit-license-headers -r android | less`
 1. Run check-license to ensure all dependencies and subdependencies have valid licenses
   * `coho check-license -r platform`
 2. Update the copy of app-hello-world (if there were any changes to it)
   * This usually lives within bin/templates somewhere
   * TODO: More details needed here
 3. For iOS only:
   * Update [CordovaLib/Classes/CDVAvailability.h](https://github.com/apache/cordova-ios/blob/master/CordovaLib/Classes/CDVAvailability.h)

by adding a new macro for the new version, e.g.

    #define __CORDOVA_2_1_0  20100


and update `CORDOVA_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED` with the latest version macro, e.g.

    #ifndef CORDOVA_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED
        #define CORDOVA_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED __CORDOVA_2_1_0
    #endif

### Creating the release branch

This step involves:

 * Updating cordova.js snapshot
 * Updating version numbers
 * Creating a release branch
 * Creating git tags for platform and js
 * Updating version in package.json file
 * Manually updating release notes
 * Tagging

Coho automates most of these steps

Prepare + Push:

    coho prepare-release-branch --version 3.5.0 -r android
    coho repo-status -r android -b master -b 3.5.x
    # If changes look right:
    coho repo-push -r android -b master -b 3.5.x
    
Update Release notes (Grab changes from the previous release until now):
    
    git log --pretty=format:'* %s' --topo-order --no-merges origin/3.4.x..origin/3.5.x
    
Manually copy output into RELEASENOTES.md.

Edit the commit descriptions - don't add the commits verbatim, usually they are meaningless to the user. Only show the ones relevant for the user (fixes, new features)

    cd cordova-android && git commit -am "$JIRA updated RELEASENOTES"

Cherry-pick the RELEASENOTES commit back into master branch

Tag:
    
    coho tag-release --version 3.5.0 -r android

## Tagging RC of cordova-cli

cordova-cli doesn't use a release branch. Follow the instructions at [tools-release-process.md](tools-release-process.md), but in addition:

Update the tool to point to the new repo versions (within `cordova-lib/platforms.js`)

Instead of the normal `npm publish` flow:

    npm publish --tag rc

** WATCH OUT! You may have to run `npm tag cordova@x.x.x latest` due to a bug in npm: https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/4837

## Publish RC to dist/dev
Ensure you have the svn repos checked out:

    coho repo-clone -r dist -r dist/dev
    
Create archives from your tags:

    coho foreach -r android "git checkout 3.5.x"
    coho create-archive -r android --dest cordova-dist-dev/$JIRA --tag 3.5.0

Sanity Check:

    coho verify-archive cordova-dist-dev/$JIRA/*.zip

Upload: (replace `android` with your platform)

    (cd cordova-dist-dev && svn add $JIRA && svn commit -m "$JIRA Uploading release candidates for android release")

Find your release here: https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/cordova/

## Testing & Documentation

Once all the repos are branched & tagged, we focus on testing & fixing all of the regressions we find.

When a regression is found:

 * Create a JIRA issue for it, and mark it as a blocker.

To submit a fix:

    git checkout master
    git commit -am 'Your commit message'
    git push origin master
    git log     # note the first five or six digits of the commit hash
    git checkout 3.5.x
    git cherry-pick -x commit_hash
    git push origin 3.5.x

### What to Test

 * Run [mobile-spec](http://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/cordova-mobile-spec.git)
   * Don't forget to checkout mobile-spec at the appropriate tag instead of using master.
   * Don't forget to set up your white-list
   * Don't forget to run through the manual tests in addition to the automatic tests
   * Test loading the app over HTTP (via "cordova serve" and setting the config.xml start page)
 * Run your platform's ./bin/create script
   * Ensure generated project builds & runs both through an IDE and through the cordova/* scripts
 * Test Project Upgrades (old-style):
   1. Create a project using the previous version of cordova
     * `coho foreach -r android "git checkout 3.4.0"`
     * `coho foreach -r android "./bin/create foo org.apache.foo foo"`
   2. Upgrade the project via the bin/update_project script:
     * `coho foreach -r android "git checkout 3.5.x"`
     * `coho foreach -r android "cd foo && ../bin/update_project"`
   3. Test the result:
     * Project should run
     * cordova/version should report the new version
 * Test Project Upgrades (new-style):
   1. Create a project using the previous version of cordova
     * `coho foreach "git checkout 3.4.0"`
     * `./cordova-mobile-spec/createmobilespec.sh`
   2. Upgrade the project via the update command:
     * `../cordova-cli/bin/cordova platform update android`
   3. Test the result:
     * Project should run
     * cordova/version should report the new version
     * Mobile Spec should still run.

#### Android Extras

 * Unit tests in: [test](https://github.com/apache/incubator-cordova-android/tree/master/test) directory

#### iOS Extras

 * Unit tests in: [CordovaLibTests/CordovaTests.xcodeproj](https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf?p=cordova-ios.git;a=tree;f=CordovaLibTests;h=88ba8e3c286159151b378efb1b0c39ef26dac550;hb=HEAD)
 * Test the Makefile via `make`
 * Run `bin/diagnose_project` on a newly created project and ensure it reports no errors.

### Documentation To Update

For your platform:
 1. Ensure the [Upgrade Guide](http://docs.phonegap.com/en/edge/guide_upgrading_index.md.html) for your platform is up-to-date
 2. Ensure the other guides listed in the sidebar are up-to-date for your platform

## Prepare Blog Post
 * Gather highlights from RELEASENOTES.md into a Release Announcement blog post
   * Instructions on [sites page README](https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/cordova/site/README.md)
 * Get blog post proofread via [Github](http://github.com/cordova/apache-blog-posts).

## Moving Tags

If you need to move a tag before the release, here is how to do that:

    $ git tag -d 3.1.0
    Deleted tag '3.1.0' (was 2a9bc20)
    $ git push origin :refs/tags/3.1.0
    To https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/cordova-docs.git
     - [deleted]         3.1.0
    $ git tag 3.1.0 7cf9fea03d7d02a13aef97a09a459e8128bd3198
    $ git push origin 3.1.0 --tags
    Total 0 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
    To https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/cordova-docs.git
     * [new tag]         3.1.0 -> 3.1.0

Then send a note to the mailing list:

    To verify you have the updated tag in your local clone, doing a "git rev-parse 3.1.0" in cordova-docs should reply with "7cf9fea03d7d02a13aef97a09a459e8128bd3198". If it is wrong, do "git fetch --tags".
