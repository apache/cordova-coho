# Release Process for ''Platforms Releases''

Before cutting any releases, read the Apache's [Releases Policy](http://www.apache.org/dev/release)

This page describes the technical steps for releasing a `Platforms Release` (see: [versioning-and-release-strategy.md](versioning-and-release-strategy.md)).

TODO: We may want to be using [signed tags](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Basics-Tagging), or at least annotated tags.

Replace `Android` with the platform you are releasing. 

## Get Buy-in

Email the dev mailing-list and see if anyone has reason to postpone the release.

E.g.:

    Subject: [DISCUSS] Cordova-Android Release

    Does anyone have any reason to delay a cordova-android platform release?
    Any outstanding patches to land?

    If not, I will start the release tomorrow.

## Creating JIRA issues

 * Create a JIRA issue to track the status of the release.
   * Make it of type "Task"
   * Title should be "Cordova-Android Platform Release _August 21, 2014_"
   * Description should be: "Following steps at https://github.com/apache/cordova-coho/blob/master/docs/platforms-release-process.md"
 * Comments should be added to this bug after each top-level step below is taken
 * Set a variable in your terminal for use later on:


    JIRA="CB-????" # Set this to the release bug.

## Update and Pin Dependencies
Ensure you're up-to-date:

    coho repo-update -r android

See if any dependencies are outdated

    (cd cordova-android && npm outdated --depth=0)

Update them in each project's `package.json` file. Make sure to run through the test section below for compatability issues. The `--depth=0` prevents from listing dependencies of dependencies.

## Release Check

Ensure license headers are present everywhere. For reference, see this [background](http://www.apache.org/legal/src-headers.html). Expect some noise in the output, for example some files from test fixtures will show up.
    
    coho audit-license-headers -r android | less
    
Ensure all dependencies and subdependencies have Apache-compatible licenses

    coho check-license -r android

#### For `iOS` only:
   * Update [CordovaLib/Classes/CDVAvailability.h](https://github.com/apache/cordova-ios/blob/master/CordovaLib/Classes/CDVAvailability.h)

by adding a new macro for the new version, e.g.

    #define __CORDOVA_2_1_0  20100


and update `CORDOVA_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED` with the latest version macro, e.g.

    #ifndef CORDOVA_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED
        #define CORDOVA_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED __CORDOVA_2_1_0
    #endif

## Prepare Release
Increase the version within package.json using SemVer, and remove the `-dev` suffix

    for l in cordova-android; do ( cd $l; v="$(grep '"version"' package.json | cut -d'"' -f4)"; if [[ $v = *-dev ]]; then v2="${v%-dev}"; echo "$l: Setting version to $v2"; sed -i '' -E 's/version":.*/version": "'$v2'",/' package.json; fi) ; done
    
If the changes merit it, manually bump the major / minor/ patch version in `package.json`. View the changes via:

    ( cd cordova-android && git log --pretty=format:'* %s' --topo-order --no-merges $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)..master )

Update the repos `RELEASENOTES.md` file with changes since the last release

    coho update-release-notes -r android
    # Then curate:
    vim cordova-android/RELEASENOTES.md

Commit these changes together into one commit

    (cd cordova-android && v="$(grep '"version"' package.json | cut -d'"' -f4)" && git commit -am "$JIRA Updated RELEASENOTES and Version for release $v")
    
`coho prepare-release-branch` command handles the following steps:
 * Updating `cordova.js` snapshot
 * Creating a release branch (if it doesn't already exist)
 * Updating version numbers (`VERSION` file & package.json). On `master`, it gives version a minor bump and adds `-dev`
    
Run the following command (make sure to replace the version below  with what is listed inside `package.json`)

    coho prepare-release-branch --version 5.0.0 -r android
    # Ensure commits look okay on both branches
    coho repo-status -r android -b master -b 5.0.x

## Testing

Once all the repos are branched, we focus on testing & fixing all of the regressions we find.

When a regression is found:

 * Create a JIRA issue for it, and mark it as a blocker.

To submit a fix:

    git checkout master
    git commit -am 'Your commit message'
    git push origin master
    git log     # note the first five or six digits of the commit hash
    git checkout 5.0.x
    git cherry-pick -x commit_hash
    git push origin 5.0.x

### What to Test

1) Run [mobile-spec](http://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/cordova-mobile-spec.git). Don't forget to run through the manual tests in addition to the automatic tests.

    ./cordova-mobile-spec/createmobilespec/createmobilespec.js --android 
    (cd mobilespec && cordova run android --device)
    
2) Create a hello world app using the cordova CLI

    cordova create ./androidTest org.apache.cordova.test androidTest
    (cd androidTest && cordova platform add ../cordova-android)
    (cd androidTest && cordova run android --device)

3) Run your platform's `./bin/create` script. Ensure generated project builds & runs both through an IDE and through the cordova/* scripts

    ./cordova-android/bin/create ./androidTest2 org.apache.cordova.test2 androidTest2
    (cd androidTest2 && ./cordova/build)
    (cd androidTest2 && ./cordova/run --device)

4) Test Project Upgrade via CLI:

    cordova create ./androidTest3 org.apache.cordova.test3 androidTest3
    (cd androidTest3 && cordova platform add android@4.1.1)
    (cd androidTest3 && cordova platform update ../cordova-android)
    (cd androidTest3 && cordova run android --device)
    (cd androidTest3 && cordova platform ls)

The output from `cordova platform ls` should show the new version of `cordova-android`.

5) Test Project Upgrade for non-cli projects:

    (cd cordova-android && git checkout 4.1.x)
    ./cordova-android/bin/create ./androidTest4 org.apache.cordova.test4 androidTest4
    (cd cordova-android && git checkout 5.0.x)
    (cd androidTest4 && ../cordova-android/bin/update .)
    (cd androidTest4 && ./cordova/build)
    (cd androidTest4 && ./cordova/run --device)
    (cd androidTest4 && ./cordova/version)

The output from `./cordova/version` should show the new version of `cordova-android`.

 6) Run cordova-lib tests

    (cd cordova-lib/cordova-lib && npm test)

Feel free to cleanup the projects you just created

    rm -rf androidTest*

#### Android Extras

 * Unit tests in: [test](https://github.com/apache/incubator-cordova-android/tree/master/test) directory

#### iOS Extras

 * Unit tests in: [CordovaLibTests/CordovaTests.xcodeproj](https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf?p=cordova-ios.git;a=tree;f=CordovaLibTests;h=88ba8e3c286159151b378efb1b0c39ef26dac550;hb=HEAD)
 * Test the Makefile via `make`
 * Run `bin/diagnose_project` on a newly created project and ensure it reports no errors.

## Push Changes:

    coho repo-status -r android -b master -b 5.0.x
    # If changes look right:
    coho repo-push -r android -b master -b 5.0.x

Tag & Push:

    coho tag-release --version 3.5.0 -r android --pretend
    # Seems okay:
    coho tag-release --version 3.5.0 -r android
    
The `coho tag-release` command also tags `cordova-js` with `android-5.0.0` and pushes it.

## Publish RC to dist/dev
Ensure you have the svn repos checked out:

    coho repo-clone -r dist -r dist/dev

Create archives from your tags:

    coho create-archive -r android --dest cordova-dist-dev/$JIRA

Sanity Check:

    coho verify-archive cordova-dist-dev/$JIRA/*.tgz

Upload:

    (cd cordova-dist-dev && svn add $JIRA && svn commit -m "$JIRA Uploading release candidates for android release")

Find your release here: https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/cordova/

## Documentation To Update

For your platform:
 1. Ensure the [Upgrade Guide](http://docs.phonegap.com/en/edge/guide_upgrading_index.md.html) for your platform is up-to-date
 2. Ensure the other guides listed in the sidebar are up-to-date for your platform

## Prepare Blog Post
 * Gather highlights from RELEASENOTES.md into a Release Announcement blog post
   * Instructions on [sites page README](https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/cordova/site/README.md)
 * Get blog post proofread via [Github](http://github.com/cordova/apache-blog-posts).

## Moving Tags

If you need to move a tag before the release, here is how to do that:

    $ git tag -d 3.1.0
    Deleted tag '3.1.0' (was 2a9bc20)
    $ git push origin :refs/tags/3.1.0
    To https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/cordova-docs.git
     - [deleted]         3.1.0
    $ git tag 3.1.0 7cf9fea03d7d02a13aef97a09a459e8128bd3198
    $ git push origin 3.1.0 && git push origin refs/tags/3.1.0
    Total 0 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
    To https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/cordova-docs.git
     * [new tag]         3.1.0 -> 3.1.0

Then send a note to the mailing list:

    To verify you have the updated tag in your local clone, doing a "git rev-parse 3.1.0" in cordova-docs should reply with "7cf9fea03d7d02a13aef97a09a459e8128bd3198". If it is wrong, do "git fetch --tags".
