# Release Process for ''Core Plugins''

Before cutting any releases, read the Apache's [Releases Policy](http://www.apache.org/dev/release)

If you have not done so already, create a GPG key (see: [setting-up-gpg.md](setting-up-gpg.md)).

Core Plugins are released at most weekly (see: [versioning-and-release-strategy.md](versioning-and-release-strategy.md)).

A plugins release is performed by a single person each week. We call this person the "Release Manager". How to select the Release Manager is still TDB.

TODO: add in RAT instruction (via coho) for next release

TODO: We may want to be using [signed tags](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Basics-Tagging), or at least annotated tags.

TODO: Add step about ensuring plugman owner

TODO: Add step about releasing cordova-plugins

TODO: Should not mention testing other than checking medic

## Get Buy-in

 1. Email the dev mailing-list and see if anyone has reason to postpone the release.
   * Subject should be "[DISCUSS] Plugins release
   * If so, agree upon a branching date / time.

## Create JIRA issues

 * Create a JIRA issue to track the status of the release.
   * Make it of type "Task"
   * Subject should be "Plugins Release _Feb 2, 2014_" (Use the current date, not the expected release date)
   * Description should be: "Following steps at https://github.com/apache/cordova-coho/blob/master/docs/plugins-release-process.md"
   * Assignee should be the Release Manager
 * Comments should be added to this bug after each top-level step below is taken
 * Set an environment variable in your terminal for use later on:


    JIRA="CB-????" # Set this to the release bug.


## Make sure you're up-to-date

    # Update your repos
    coho repo-status -r plugins -b master
    coho repo-update -r plugins
    coho foreach -r plugins "git checkout master"

## Identify which plugins have changes

    coho repo-update -r plugins
    coho foreach -r plugins "git checkout master"
    ACTIVE=$(for l in cordova-plugin-*; do ( cd $l; git log --pretty=format:'* %s' --topo-order --no-merges $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)..master | grep -v "Incremented plugin version" > /dev/null && echo $l); done | xargs echo)

## Ensure license headers are present everywhere:

    coho audit-license-headers -r plugins | less

For reference, see this [background](http://www.apache.org/legal/src-headers.html)

## Ensure all dependencies and subdependencies have Apache-compatible licenses

    coho check-license -r plugins

## Update RELEASENOTES.md & Version
Remove the ''-dev'' suffix on the version in plugin.xml.

    for l in $ACTIVE; do ( cd $l; v="$(grep version= plugin.xml | grep -v xml | head -n1 | cut -d'"' -f2)"; v2="${v%-dev}"; if [ "$v" != "$v2" ]; then echo "$l: Setting version to $v2"; sed -i '' -E s:"version=\"$v\":version=\"$v2\":" plugin.xml; fi) ; done

If the changes merit it, manually bump the major / minor version instead of the micro. Manual process, but list the changes via:

    for l in $ACTIVE; do ( cd $l; echo $l; git log --pretty=format:'* %s' --topo-order --no-merges $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)..master | grep -v "Incremented plugin version" ); done

For each of the plugins that have a test project inside it, update the version number there (`cordova-plugin-*/tests/plugin.xml`) to match the version of the plugin itself (`cordova-plugin-*/plugin.xml`).

    for l in $ACTIVE; do ( cd $l; v="$(grep version= plugin.xml | grep -v xml | head -n1 | cut -d'"' -f2)"; vt="$(grep version= tests/plugin.xml | grep -v xml | head -n1 | cut -d'"' -f2)"; if [ "$v" != "$vt" ]; then echo "$l: Setting version to $v"; sed -i '' -E s:"version=\"$vt\":version=\"$v\":" tests/plugin.xml; fi); done

Update its RELEASENOTES.md file with changes

    # Add new heading to release notes with version and date
    DATE=$(date "+%h %d, %Y")
    for l in $ACTIVE; do ( cd $l; v="$(grep version= plugin.xml | grep -v xml | head -n1 | cut -d'"' -f2)"; echo -e "\n### $v ($DATE)" >> RELEASENOTES.md; git log --pretty=format:'* %s' --topo-order --no-merges $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)..master | grep -v "Incremented plugin version" >> RELEASENOTES.md); done
    # Then curate:
    vim ${ACTIVE// //RELEASENOTES.md }/RELEASENOTES.md

Print the curated changes for plugins (save this text for the blog post, after deleting the unnecessary lines):

    for l in $ACTIVE; do ( cd $l; v="$(grep version= plugin.xml | grep -v xml | head -n1 | cut -d'"' -f2)"; id=$(grep -o '\bid=\"[^\"]*\"' plugin.xml | head -n1 | cut -d'"' -f2);  echo -e "\n\`$id@$v\`"; git diff -U0 RELEASENOTES.md | sed 's/^\+//' ); done

Add a comment to the JIRA issue with the output from:

    for l in $ACTIVE; do ( cd $l; id="$(grep id= plugin.xml | grep -v xml | grep -v engine | grep -v param | head -1 | cut -d'"' -f2)"; v="$(grep version= plugin.xml | grep -v xml | head -n1 | cut -d'"' -f2)"; echo $id@$v; awk "{ if (p) print } /$DATE/ { p = 1 } " < RELEASENOTES.md; echo); done

Commit these changes together (plugin.xml, RELEASENOTES.md, tests/plugin.xml)

    for l in $ACTIVE; do ( cd $l; v="$(grep version= plugin.xml | grep -v xml | head -n1 | cut -d'"' -f2)"; git commit -am "$JIRA Updated version and RELEASENOTES.md for release $v"); done

## Tag

    for l in $ACTIVE; do ( cd $l; v="r$(grep version= plugin.xml | grep -v xml | head -n1 | cut -d'"' -f2)"; echo "Tagging $l to $v"; git tag "$v" ); done

## Test
 * Create mobilespec using the old versions of plugins (by checking them out to the previous tag)
 * Run through mobilespec, ensuring to do manual tests that relate to changes in the RELEASENOTES.md

## Update version

    # update the plugin
    for l in $ACTIVE; do ( cd $l; v="$(grep version= plugin.xml | grep -v xml | head -n1 | cut -d'"' -f2)"; v_no_dev="${v%-dev}"; if [ "$v" = "$v_no_dev" ]; then v2="$(echo $v|awk -F"." '{$NF+=1}{print $0RT}' OFS="." ORS="")-dev"; echo "$l: Setting version to $v2"; sed -i '' -E s:"version=\"$v\":version=\"$v2\":" plugin.xml; fi) ; done
    # update the nested test
    for l in $ACTIVE; do ( cd $l; v="$(grep version= plugin.xml | grep -v xml | head -n1 | cut -d'"' -f2)"; vt="$(grep version= tests/plugin.xml | grep -v xml | head -n1 | cut -d'"' -f2)"; if [ "$v" != "$vt" ]; then echo "$l: Setting version to $v"; sed -i '' -E s:"version=\"$vt\":version=\"$v\":" tests/plugin.xml; fi); done
    for l in $ACTIVE; do (cd $l; git commit -am "$JIRA Incremented plugin version." ); done

## Push tags and changes
    # Sanity check:
    coho repo-status -r plugins
    coho foreach -r plugins "git status -s"
    # Push:
    for l in $ACTIVE; do ( cd $l; git push --tags https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/$l.git master); done
    # Check that it was all successful:
    coho repo-update -r plugins
    coho repo-status -r plugins

## Publish to dist/dev
Ensure you have the svn repos checked out:

    coho repo-clone -r dist -r dist/dev

Create archives from your tags:

    coho create-archive -r ${ACTIVE// / -r } --dest cordova-dist-dev/$JIRA

Sanity Check:

    # Manually double check version numbers are correct on the file names
    # Then run:
    coho verify-archive cordova-dist-dev/$JIRA/*.zip

Upload:

    cd cordova-dist-dev && svn up && svn add $JIRA && svn commit -m "$JIRA Uploading release candidates for plugins release"

* Find your release here: https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/cordova/

## Prepare Blog Post
 * Combine highlights from RELEASENOTES.md into a Release Announcement blog post
   * Instructions on [sites page README](https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/cordova/site/README.md)
 * Get blog post proof-read.

## Start VOTE Thread
Send an email to dev ML with:

__Subject:__

    [VOTE] Plugins Release

__Body:__

    Please review and vote on the release of this plugins release.

    Release issue: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-XXXX

    The plugins have been published to dist/dev:
    https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/cordova/CB-XXXX/

    The packages were published from their corresponding git tags:
    PASTE OUTPUT OF: coho print-tags -r ${ACTIVE// / -r }

    Upon a successful vote I will upload the archives to dist/, upload them to the Plugins Registry, and post the corresponding blog post.

    Voting guidelines: https://github.com/apache/cordova-coho/blob/master/docs/release-voting.md

    Voting will go on for a minimum of 48 hours.

    I vote +1:
    * Ran coho audit-license-headers over the relevant repos
    * Ran coho check-license to ensure all dependencies and subdependencies have Apache-compatible licenses
    * Ensured continuous build was green when repos were tagged


## Email the result of the vote
Respond to the vote thread with:

__Subject:__

    [RESULT][VOTE] Plugins Release

__Body:__

    The vote has now closed. The results are:

    Positive Binding Votes: (# of PMC members that +1'ed)

    .. names of all +1 PMC members ..

    Negative Binding Votes: (# of PMC members that -1'ed)

    .. names of all -1 PMC members ..

    Other Votes:

    .. list any non-binding votes, from non-PMC members ..

    The vote has passed.

_Note: list of PMC members: http://people.apache.org/committers-by-project.html#cordova-pmc_

## If the Vote does *not* Pass
* Revert adding of `-dev` on master branch
* Address the concerns (on master branch)
* Re-tag release using `git tag -f`
* Add back `-dev`
* Start a new vote


## Publish to dist/

    cd cordova-dist
    svn up
    for l in $ACTIVE; do ( svn rm plugins/$l* ); done
    cp ../cordova-dist-dev/$JIRA/* plugins/
    svn add plugins/*
    svn commit -m "$JIRA Published plugins release to dist"

    cd ../cordova-dist-dev
    svn up
    svn rm $JIRA
    svn commit -m "$JIRA Removing release candidates from dist/dev"
    cd ..

Find your release here: https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/cordova/plugins/

## Publish to Plugins Registry

Note that plugman works on directories, in contrast to `npm publish` that works on tarballs. So be aware that the following command will use your development directories, so make sure they are checked out to the correct tag before running the `plugman publish` command:

    for l in $ACTIVE; do ( cd $l; echo -n "$l: "; plugman publish . ); done

Actually a better alternative would be to unzip the voted content to a temporary location and publish with that:

    cd cordova-dist-dev/$JIRA; mkdir tmp_publish; cd tmp_publish; for l in $ACTIVE; do (unzip ../$l-r*.zip; cd $l; echo -n "$l: "; plugman publish .; cd ..) done; cd ..; rm -r tmp_publish


## Post blog Post

See [full instructions](http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/cordova/site/README.md?view=markup).

    cd cordova-website
    svn update
    cd apache-blog-posts
    git pull
    cd ..
    grunt updateBlog
    rake build
    # correct any build errors, and repeat until clean run
    rake serve
    # preview contents at localhost:4000 and repeat until satisfied
    (cd apache-blog-posts && git add . && git commit)
    svn status
    svn add NEW_FILES_HERE
    # commit the new and modified files
    svn commit

## Do other announcements

    Do the same things regarding announcements as described in cadence-release-process, where they make sense.

## Close JIRA Issue
 * Double check that the issue has comments that record the steps you took
 * Mark it as fixed

## Finally:

 * Update *these instructions* if they were missing anything.
